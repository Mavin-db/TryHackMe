## OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model) is a fundamental, seven-layered framework that dictates how all network devices send, receive, and interpret data across a network. A core benefit of the OSI Model is that devices with different functions and designs can communicate seamlessly as long as they adhere to the model. As data moves through these layers, specific processes occur, and information is added, a process known as **encapsulation**. The model is crucial for troubleshooting and breaking down networking processes.

**The seven layers are arranged from Layer 7 (Application) down to Layer 1 (Physical).**

###Layer 7 (Application)
Is the layer most familiar to users, governing how users interact with data through protocols (like DNS) and providing interfaces (such as a Graphical User Interface or GUI in browsers and email clients). 

###Layer 6 (Presentation)
Acts as a **translator**, standardizing data format between different software applications and handling security features like encryption (HTTPS).

###Layer 5 (Session)
Manages the connection by creating a unique **session** between the two computers. It synchronises devices and begins dividing the data into smaller chunks called **packets**.

###Layer 4 (Transport)
Is vital for transmission and uses two main protocols: **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**. TCP prioritises **reliability and guarantee**, reserving a continuous connection and performing error checking to ensure data accuracy. TCP is slower but ideal for services like file sharing and email. Conversely, UDP is much **faster** but connectionless; it does not reserve a continuous connection, guarantee delivery, or perform error checking, making it suitable for video streaming or VoIP where speed outweighs the risk of minor data loss.

###Layer 3 (Network)
Is where the "magic of **routing**" takes place. It determines the most optimal path for data to travel based on factors like path shortness, reliability, and physical connection speed. This layer deals specifically with **IP addresses**, and devices capable of routing packets, such as **routers**, are known as Layer 3 devices.

###Layer 2 (Data Link)
Focuses on **physical addressing** by adding the unique **MAC address** (Media Access Control address) of the receiving device to the packet. The Network Interface Card (NIC) is a key hardware component associated with Layer 2. 

###Layer 1 (Physical)
References the actual hardware components, like **ethernet cables**, that use electrical signals to transfer data in a **binary numbering system** (ones and zeros).
