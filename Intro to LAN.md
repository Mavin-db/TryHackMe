##Introduction to LAN - Networking Basics
Provides an overview of Local Area Network (LAN) topologies and key protocols and devices that manage private networks. Network topology refers to the design or structure of a network, specifically how everything is connected. There are three main topologies: **Star**, where devices connect to a central device (like a switch or hub), noted for being the most common, reliable, and scalable despite higher costs; **Bus**, which relies on a single backbone cable, is cost-efficient but prone to slow performance and bottlenecks, and lacks redundancy; and **Ring** (or Token) topology, where devices connect in a loop, requiring little cabling, being less prone to bottlenecks than the Bus, but where a single failure breaks the entire network

####Essential networking hardware and concepts
Routers connect different networks and pass data between them using routing, which involves translating addressing schemes and controlling packet flow. Switches aggregate multiple devices within a single network, using packet switching to break data into smaller, manageable chunks called packets, which enhances efficiency; switches do not perform routing like routers but can identify devices internally. Both switches and routers can be connected to increase network redundancy. Furthermore, the video details key protocols: the **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** associates a device's MAC address (physical identifier) with its IP address (logical identifier) using broadcast requests and replies stored in an ARP cache; and the **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** automatically assigns IP addresses to devices through a four-step process involving Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledgement packets. 

**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a network into smaller, miniature networks to enhance efficiency, security, and control, used commonly in larger organisations to separate departments or functions. 

**Subnets** utilise IP addresses in three ways: 
- to identify the network address (the start of the network)
- the host address (a specific device on the subnet)
- the default gateway (the device, usually a router, used to exit the network)
